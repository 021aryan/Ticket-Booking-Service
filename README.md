# Ticket-Booking-Service
1)To build a booking service that allows users to choose seats and book using the Node.js framework, you can follow the following steps:

2)Set up a Node.js environment and install the necessary dependencies such as Express, Body-parser, and MongoDB.

3)Create a database in MongoDB to store the seat booking information, such as seat number, availability, and user details.

4)Define the routes in the Express application to handle the booking requests from the client-side.

5)Build the client-side interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the seat layout, allow users to select seats, and submit their booking details.

6)Implement the server-side logic to update the seat availability in the database and store the user's booking details.

7)Handle errors and exceptions such as seat already booked, invalid seat number, etc., and display appropriate messages to the user.
